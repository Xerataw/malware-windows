# How to configure the .vscode to develop on MACos
First you need to install mingw-w64 with homebrew.

Then create a .vscode inside your project.
Create a c_cpp_properties.json and settings.json
Here's a sample of the c_cpp_properties.json
```json
{
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Mac",
            "includePath": [
                "${workspaceFolder}/**",
                "/opt/homebrew/Cellar/mingw-w64/11.0.1_1/toolchain-x86_64/x86_64-w64-mingw32/include"
            ],
            "defines": [
                "_DEBUG",
                "UNICODE",
                "_UNICODE"
            ],
            "compilerPath": "/opt/homebrew/bin/x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++",
            "cStandard": "c11",
            "cppStandard": "c++17",
            "intelliSenseMode": "gcc-x64"
        }
    ],
    "version": 4
}
```

Here's a sample of the settings.json
```json
{
    "files.associations": {
        "stdio.h": "c",
        "windows.h": "c"
    }
}
```

# How to build the project
just run this command: x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ -o Myexecutable.exe -static-libgcc -static-libstdc++ main.cpp
